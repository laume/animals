Data Overview

The training set contains 196,157 images from 138 different locations in Southern California. You may also choose to use supplemental training data from iNaturalist 2017, iNaturalist 2018, iNaturalist 2019, and images simulated with Microsoft AirSim. As a courtesy, we have curated all the images from iNaturalist 2017/2018 containing classes that might be in the test set and mapped them into the iWildCam categories. This data (which we call "iNat Idaho") can be downloaded from our git page here.

The test set contains 153,730 images from 100 locations in Idaho.

The competition task is to label each image with one of the following label ids:
